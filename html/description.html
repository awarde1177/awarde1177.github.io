		<h2>Computer Science</h2>
		
		<h3>Program Description</h3>
		<p>Do you want to know how to design and program the computers 
		powering some of today’s greatest innovations? Ever wondered 
		how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is, how 
		Google’s self-driving car is even possible, or how your music 
		and photos live in the cloud? Maybe you want to know how 
		computers protect businesses — and people — and other 
		cybersecurity issues. AUM’s Computer Science Program, with 
		a curriculum based on the latest ACM/IEEE recommendations and 
		an emphasis on high-performance computing,  will prepare you 
		for a career in computer programming, networking, database 
		management, multimedia design or technology architecture.</p>

		<h3>Points of Pride</h3>
		<p>You'll have access to the most powerful computational 
		resources and expertise in the country through our partnership 
		with the NSF-supported Extreme Science and Engineering 
		Discovery Environment.  Computer Science faculty are engaged in 
		the private sector, supporting research and partnerships with 
		national and international user groups and initiatives.</p>
		
		<h3>Put Your Degree to Work</h3>
		<p>Note: While salaries vary depending on several factors including your level of experience, education and training, and geography and industry, here is a sampling of the future job growth and salaries in this area.</p>
		<p>Employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 12 percent from 2014 to 2024, faster than the average for all other occupations. The most recent median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations $79,390 — higher than the median annual wage for all other occupations.</p>
